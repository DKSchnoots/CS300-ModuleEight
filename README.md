1. What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

In this course, we were solving different problems involving data models such as Hash Tables and Binary Trees. We also had to implement the use of these data models. 

2 How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

I looked at both the pros and cons for each type of data structure. In different situations there are benefits to using one over the other. 

3. How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

I used open communications to overcome a lot of the issues I experienced. I reached out for resources when I needed help. I also turned to family and friends to help me better understand certain assignments.

4. How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

When working on project one, I really got to  gain an understanding of algorithms. I also got to work more with C++ where I could gain more time using the language. Coding is very hands on for me, the more I do it the more Iâ€™ll understand.

5. How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

In this course, a lot of the assignments helped build up the projects. From the individual milestones, the feedback I gained helped me with working towards my finals.
